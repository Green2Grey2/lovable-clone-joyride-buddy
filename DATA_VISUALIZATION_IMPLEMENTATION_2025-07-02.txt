   - Training tips and recommendations

7. SOCIAL LEADERBOARD (SocialLeaderboard.tsx)
   - Real-time updates using Supabase subscriptions
   - Multiple metrics: Steps, Calories, Duration, Streak
   - Time-based filtering: Today, Week, Month
   - Rank change indicators
   - User avatars and department tags
   - Community challenges integration

8. AI WORKOUT INSIGHTS (AIWorkoutInsights.tsx)
   - Pattern analysis across 4 dimensions
   - 6 types of insights: improvements, warnings, suggestions, achievements
   - Actionable recommendations
   - Progress tracking with metrics
   - Interactive insight cards
   - Smart tips based on user patterns

9. ANALYTICS PAGE (Analytics.tsx)
   - Tabbed navigation with 5 sections
